Dear Editor,

We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled "GDNF Acutely Modulates Neuronal Excitability and A-type Potassium Channels in Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons", which we wish to be considered for publication in Nature Neuroscience. 

GDNF has long been thought to be a potent neurotrophic factor for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which are degenerated in Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we report an unexpected, acute effect of GDNF on A-type potassium channels, leading to a potentiation of neuronal excitability, in the dopaminergic neurons in culture as well as in adult brain slices. Further, we show that GDNF regulates the K+ channels through a mechanism that involves activation of MAP kinase. Thus, this study has revealed, for the first time, an acute modulation of ion channels by GDNF. Our findings challenge the classic view of GDNF as a long-term survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and suggest that the normal function of GDNF is to regulate neuronal excitability, and consequently dopamine release. These results may also have implications in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 

Due to a direct competition and conflict of interest, we request that Drs. XXX of Harvard Univ., and YY of Yale Univ. not be considered as reviewers. With thanks for your consideration, I am ZZ.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Editor,

We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled "Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein frequenin mediates GDNF-induced potentiation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and transmitter release", which we wish to be considered for publication in Neuron. 

We believe that two aspects of this manuscript will make it interesting to general readers of Neuron. First, we report that GDNF has a long-term regulatory effect on neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular synapses. This provides the first physiological evidence for a role of this new family of neurotrophic factors in functional synaptic transmission. Second, we show that the GDNF effect is mediated by enhancing the expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein frequenin. Further, GDNF and frequenin facilitate synaptic transmission by enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity, leading to an enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Thus, this study has identified, for the first time, a molecular target that mediates the long-term, synaptic action of a neurotrophic factor. Our findings may also have general implications in the cell biology of neurotransmitter release.

Dear Editor,   

Enclosed are copies of a manuscript entitled "BDNF and NT-4/5 Promote the Development of Long-Term Potentiation in the Hippocampus", which we wish to be considered for publication in Nature.   As you know, there is a great deal of interest and excitement recently in understanding the role of neurotrophins in synapse development and plasticity.  Our manuscript provides, for the first time, the physiological evidence that neurotrophins regulate long-term potentiation (LTP).  The main point of the paper is that the neurotrophins BDNF and NT-4 induce an earlier appearance of LTP in developing hippocampus.   In contrast to recent Science article by Erin Schuman's group, we (and several other LTP groups) did not see that BDNF enhance basal synaptic transmission in adullt hippocampus.  However, we found that in adult hippocampus, inhibition of BDNF/TrkB activity attenuated LTP, and weak tetanus that normally cannot induce LTP produced enduring LTP.  These findings may have implications in the basic mechanism for regulation of synapse development and long-term modulation of synaptic efficacy.

Because of the rather competitive nature of the field and the important implication of our findings, we have not yet presented this work in any public forum.  However, confidential discussion with several prominent neuroscientists such as 111 and 222 have generated tremendous excitement.  Thus, we feel that this work is of general interest and is suitable for publication in Nature.  We would like to suggest Drs. aaa of Yale Univ., bbb of Harvard Medical School, and ccc of Univ. of California-Berkeley, as reviewers for this manuscript.  Due to a direct competition and conflict of interest, we request that Dr. XX and YY. not be considered as reviewers.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
